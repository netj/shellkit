ShellKit
========
A skeleton code generator for tools written mostly in shell scripts.

Usage
-----

Create a directory for the tool's source code and run `generate-tool`:

    mkdir my-tool-src
    cd my-tool-src
    git clone https://github.com/netj/shellkit.git
    shellkit/generate-tool name_of+my-tool.123

You can now build it with make:

    make

Or, you can enjoy our development environment:

    . Developer.sh
    m
    name_of+my-tool.123 subcommand
